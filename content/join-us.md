## Help us make the nordic tech industry better.

Crip in Tech is on a mission to improve how the world writes software and tests. We can't do it without your help.

We're consultants that integrate with client teams. Because no two engagements are alike, we don't expect our agents to be experts in the particular business domains and software systems of our clients. Instead, we're looking for voracious learners, people who find ways to deliver value, and deep thinkers who can glean useful insights that push our clients (and our practice) forward.

Our recipe for success has been simple: find skilled, driven developers and QA's and trust them with the autonomy to solve their client's problems as they best see fit. That's it. Really. Most companies try to ensure success by dictating where, when, and how work is done. Not us. Instead, we demonstrate iterative progress continuously by working in the open and building trust by providing value.

By proving ourselves accountable, we've earned freedom over how we work. The reason our agents share so many great things with the community is because we're each free to make working at Crip in Tech our dream job. And we want the same for you.
